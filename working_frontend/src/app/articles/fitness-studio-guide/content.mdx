# Opening a Fitness Studio: Where to Start

Austin’s health-conscious culture makes it a great place for a fitness studio — but the **wrong location** can eat your margins fast.

## What to prioritize:

- Young professionals or affluent suburban families
- Limited nearby gyms or yoga studios
- Parking availability (especially for early AM classes)
- Walkable, safe streets

## High-Potential ZIPs

### 78704 (Zilker / South Lamar)

- Trendy, affluent, lots of apartment dwellers
- High gym adoption rate

### 78701 (Downtown)

- Great for boutique training & after-work classes
- Expensive rent, but strong membership retention

### 78745 (South Austin)

- More affordable
- Less saturated fitness market
