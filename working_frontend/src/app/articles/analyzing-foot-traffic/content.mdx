# How to Analyze Foot Traffic for a New Business

You’ve got your product. You’ve got your lease offer. But do you really know how many people pass by your location every day?

## Why Foot Traffic Matters

- It drives organic discovery — especially for walk-in dependent businesses.
- It affects your brand perception.
- It lowers your marketing spend if chosen wisely.

## What Tools to Use

1. **Mobile data providers** (like SafeGraph or Placer.ai)
2. **Local business directories**
3. **Foot traffic heatmaps** like the one built into Firestore

## Ideal Benchmarks

A coffee shop might want 500–1000 daily passersby. A boutique may only need 100–200 high-intent visitors in the right location.

## Pro Tip

Don’t just look at raw traffic — check traffic **quality**. A busy road is meaningless if nobody stops or notices your storefront.
