# Where to Open a Boutique in Miami

Miami’s fashion-forward residents love unique boutiques — but location is everything. Here’s how to **position your store** where people will find it, stop in, and buy.

## Look for:

- Female-heavy demographics
- Mid-high income ZIPs
- Tourist foot traffic or walkable neighborhoods
- Limited fast fashion nearby
