# Top Mistakes When Picking a Business Location

Choosing where to open your business can make or break your success. While every entrepreneur wants the *perfect* spot, many fall into common traps.

## 1. Skipping Traffic & Visibility Analysis

Foot traffic isn’t just a bonus — it’s your walk-in revenue engine. If your location doesn’t have steady, visible traffic, customers won’t find you.

**Use Firestore** to compare ZIP codes by traffic volume and visibility.

## 2. Underestimating Nearby Competitors

You might think competition validates your idea — but opening next to three similar shops can drain your growth.

→ Firestore helps you **map local competition density** instantly.

## 3. Ignoring Parking & Accessibility

Lack of parking or awkward entry points can frustrate customers. It’s not just about being “downtown” — it’s about being easy to visit.

## 4. Not Adjusting for Demographics

Are the local income levels, age ranges, and shopping behavior aligned with your target audience?

Use Firestore’s **ZIP-score filters** to prioritize zones that actually match your customer profile.
