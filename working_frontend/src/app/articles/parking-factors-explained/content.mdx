# Parking Factors Explained

Parking often gets overlooked, but it can make or break a customerâ€™s decision to stop at your store.

## Why Parking Matters

- It affects how accessible your store is.
- It impacts how long customers are likely to stay.
- It can be a dealbreaker in crowded cities.

## What to Look For

1. Shared vs. dedicated lots
2. Metered vs. free parking
3. Visibility and signage from the road

> "A great location with no parking is sometimes worse than a good location with plenty of it."
